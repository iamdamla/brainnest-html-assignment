          classics better than other genres.

        <li>Hiking</li>
        <p>
          I go often hiking in the mountains and each year we go with my husband
          for a long hiking vacations like 2-3 weeks. We did so far Lycian Way
          in Turkey (3 weeks), Stevenson Way in France (2 weeks).

        <li>Travelling</li>
        <p>
          I like the explore the world, however; because of the Covid I couldn't
          travel anywhere recently.

        <li>Camping</li>
        <p>
          My hike is usually ending with a camping and I like to wake up with
          the nature's sound and the sunshine.
